# Algo Visualizer

Dealing with path-finding algorithms can be frustrating if one cannot develop some intuition around how they work. By building an online visualizer for some of the most common path-finding algorithms, I was able to reinforce a lot of what I've learned by implementing them from scratch.

To learn more about algorithms and data structures, I have a repo dedicated for that. [Check it out](https://github.com/GoodluckH/learn/tree/main/Computer%20Science).

The project is rudimentary at this stage but I plan to add more features such as setting up obstacles, automaticaly sizing the canvas based on user device, better animations, and more. Feel free to fork this project out if you find it helpful!
